## Character-level Intra Attention Network
Implementation of the Character-level Intra Attention Network as a master thesis project in [Universitat Politècnica de Catalunya · BarcelonaTech](http://www.upc.edu/). 
Task description of the task can be seen at [RepEval 2017](https://repeval2017.github.io/shared/). 

### Requirements
Code is written in python 2.7 and requires [Keras 2](https://github.com/fchollet/keras).

### Data
Dataset could be downloaded at [MultiNLI](http://www.nyu.edu/projects/bowman/multinli/) and [SNLI](http://nlp.stanford.edu/projects/snli/). 
Dataset should be be put in folder ./data and renamed as train.jsoonl, train_snli.jsonl, dev.jsoonl, test_matched.jsonl and test_mismatched.jsonl.
